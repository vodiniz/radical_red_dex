Changelog 2.2b to v2.3:

- Added an Easy Option, Minimal Grinding Option, Hardcore Mode, Restricted Mode
●	- Easy Mode makes boss battles a level lower, allows items in boss battles, shift mode can be used, and boss battles have no EVs
●	- Minimal Grinding makes all Pokemon have perfect IVs (Gift Pokemon, Wild Pokemon, Boss Pokemon (except slight tweaks for Hidden Power)), and EVs cannot be obtained. AI will also use no EVs. Trading is forbidden in Minimal Grinding Mode.
●	Hardcore Mode makes boss battles harder and simply downright unfair while also restricting certain moves/abilities from the user (weather ability/moves, most stat-boosting moves, and more are prohibited with some exceptions).
○	Egg Moves cannot be obtained from DexNav in this mode
○	Some mandatory trainers in routes are also turned into minibosses, indicated by a pre-battle transition
○	It's automatically complimented with Minimal Grinding mode to make this grueling experience less tedious
○	Hardcore Mode has some minor modifications to the levels in Level Cap so that you can evolve your starter before Brock and get your final starter evolution before Lt Surge
- Restricted Mode simply has the restrictions that Hardcore Mode has (Certain Abilities, Moves are forbidden) but with default Radical Red boss battles
- The Stat Scanner has been updated with a graphical interface that also displays Happiness Level, Base Stats, and steps left for an egg to hatch (Please note the steps left counter is not an approximate amount!) Credits to Azimuth on WAH for this!
- there is spanish on this screen ('atras' instead of 'back') and the iv/evs arent perfectly symmetrical atm... will try to fix when I can :p
- Added pre-battle transitions for all boss battles (the panning thing you see before fighting the Elite Four/Champion)
- A part of Diglett Cave is accessible before attaining Cut for more early game diversity (TM78 Low Sweep can be found in here)
- Some evolution stones have been made available earlier around Cerulean City
- Early game bosses (Falkner, Brock, Misty) have become slightly more difficult in tandem with these new options available in the early game
- Updated attack animations for Cut (to better reflect its new Steel typing), Leech Life (to better reflect its 80 BP rather than its old 20 BP), Wicked Blow, Surging Strikes, Grassy Glide, Rising Voltage, Expanding Force, Flip Turn, Snap Trap, Scale Shot
- Added text to Hall of Fame to reflect what version the game was completed on
- Screen before the confetti also shows what game modes it was completed on (Easy, Hardcore, Randomizer, etc)

Nerfs:
- King's Shield does not lower Attack on contact anymore (previously lowered Attack by two stages)
- Wide Guard now can fail on consecutive usage (same formula as protect)
- Strength Sap PP 10->5, also uses twice the amount of PP (each usage costs 2 PP instead of just 1)

Buffs:
- Overheat, Draco Meteor, Psycho Boost, Fleur Cannon, Leaf Storm accuracy 90->100
- Inferno BP 100->120 (matches Zap Cannon)
- Mega Drain BP 40->60 (Great for Technician Roserade, Sceptile)
- Misty Explosion - Now also halves target's SpDef

- Self Sufficient: - Heal 1/16 at the end of every turn (leftovers as an ability basically, Mega Alcremie and Torterra)

Pokemon Changes:
- Mega-Sceptile Rework: Adaptability->Technician Attack 110->135, SpA 130->110
 - Notable boosted moves: Bullet Seed, Rock Tomb, Dual Chop, Scale Shot, Mega Drain (Now 60 BP), Dragon Breath, Double Kick, Hidden Power
- Sceptile Grass->Grass/Dragon, Attack 85->105, SpA 105->85, learns Scale Shot at Level 80
 - A lot of people requested Sceptile to be turned into a physical attacker as it fits his design and Adaptability was honestly just a lazy buff idea I came up with to make it busted since its Brendan's signature mon; Technician has pretty excellent synergy with a lot of his moves so the main reason for this change is that it's a bit cooler imo

Changelog from 2.0f to 2.1 (major facelift):

Graphical Updates:
- Updated battle backgrounds (Credits to NateRiver, Omega/WesleyFG)
- Updated Bag UI (Credits to Nisarg, JK)
- Updated Textbox (Credits to ! hackito)
- Platinum style HP bar (Credits to  YoY-X)
- Updated overworld sprites for a lotta shit... Raid Jewel->Raid Den (Creds to Delta231 for the FRLG HGGSS style sprites)
- Now have overworld sprites for: Johto Gym Leaders, Archer, Ariana, Master Ball, Mega Stone, Legendary Swords of Justice) (Credits to Pokemonrater, thebrawlunit for archer/ariana/giovanni sprites, Jo7A for Johto Gym Leader Sprites)
- Updated Sword Shield style Type Icons (credits to VentZX, DrSeuss )

Changes/Additions:
- MAX LEVEL HAS BEEN SET BACK TO 100. If you have Pokemon over Level 100 they will be set back to 100 after a battle.
 - I originally set the max level to 250 for fun and didn't put much thought to it. With postgame around the corner, I've
 decided a max level would deliver a far more enjoyable experience as having every Pokemon at a constant level would help
 with consistent Speed tiers and reduce the amount of grinding necessary to get Pokemon up to speed.

- When selecting a move, you can now view the types of each Pokemon on the battlefield (CFRU feature)
 - Because of the extensive changes to a lot of Pokemon's typings, I figured this would be a very convenient feature to have

- Poltergeist has been added as TM67 (Found in Victory Road)
 - Compatibilities is all Ghost types except Aegislash line, Dragapult line, Mimikyu, Necrozma Dawn Wings
- Scorching Sands has been added as TM110, found in Game Corner.
 - Compatibilities is all SwSh compatibilities + Houndour, Houndoom, Sunflora, Sudowoodo, Cyndaquil line, Magmar line, Torchic line, Nosepass line, Salandit line, Amaura line, Tyrunt line, Fennekin line,
 Dwebble line, Darumaka line, Slugma line, Numel line, Cacnea line, Chimchar line, Cranidos line, Shieldon line, Gible line,
 Hippopotas line, Heatran
- TM Body Press moved from left of Celadon to Cerulean Cave
 - Move is extremely powerful with its cheesing potential when used in combination with Iron Defense or Bulk Up; Celadon is definitely way too early to receive this move

- Pokemon do not automatically show Dex entry if its their first time being caught
- Dual Wingbeat has been added as TM100 found in Route 16 (where TM body Press used to be)
 - Combatibilities is all SwSh compatibilities + Pokemon that can learn Wing Attack
 - Removed Dual Wingbeat from following Pokemon's level up learnset(THEY STILL LEARN THROUGH THIS TM):
  Hydreigon, Archen, Archeops, Ducklett, Swanna, Scyther, Scizor, Clefable, Celebi,
  Mothim, Moltres, Zapdos, Articuno, Murkrow, Honchkrow, Mew, Ledyba, Ledian, Emolga,
  Rowlet, Dartrix, Decidueye

- Added Tailwind, Megahorn to Cinnabar Move Tutor, Foul Play to Saffron Move Tutor, Psychic Fangs to Vermilion Move Tutor

- Attack Name Change: Fishy Rend -> FishiousRend
- Attack Name Change: First Press-> FirstImpress

Pokemon Changes:
Corvisquire evolves into Corviknight at Level 60 instead of 38
 - One of the cheesiest Pokemon in the game thanks to its typing, bulk, and access to Body Press (among many things).
 I'm reluctant to nerf it at the moment, so I've made it irrelevant in the midgame with this late evolution + lack of early access to Body Press

Rattled has been removed from the game (to make room for Unseen Fist).

Mega Coalossal Defense 120->125, SpDef 100->105
